Thoughts:
- Nums is non-empty

Approaches:
1) We could find the leftSums and rightSums of nums but then we'd have several possible indexing issues(does it exist in the correct array, index offsets, etc.)
2) We could setup leftSum = 0 and rightSum = sum(nums) and then as we iterate leftSum += element and rightSum -= element and we can perform a comparison check to return the idx if valid.

class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        leftSum, rightSum = 0, sum(nums)

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            rightSum -= num
            if leftSum == rightSum:
                return i
            leftSum += num
        
        return -1
